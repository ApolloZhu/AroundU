**Project Summary**:

> A platform for college student to post and find events within the university communityã€‚

**Project Description:**

Our goal is to allow user(students) more easy to find events or activities around them, and build connection or friendship with other through those events. With that idea, we believe that an interactive map-based interface would be a good approach to communicate with the user, and encourage user to attend events around them. As almost all in-person events or activity are naturally associate with a location, it is more intuitive for the user to found what events are available in a map. Beside that, map can also be a media that connect the virtual contents to the reality, giving the user a sense of authenticity and trust, which is commonalty lacking in todays social media.

**Main features:**

1. Register and validate user account: User can create an account via Email
2. Create an event or activity: User able to create/post an event by filling out some require info, like event title, time, size, public/private, and location. etc.
3.  Join or leave an event or activity: User should able to join or leave a specific selected event or activity.
4. Manage events/activities: Event initiator is able to edit the event details, like change time and event size. 
5. Interactive map-based interface: Display the events/activities in an interactive map-based interface. Allowing the user to interactive with the map element to preform verity of task like see, found, and join specific event or activity.
